<h2>About</h2>

<p>Rekt Degen A community dedicated to innovation and impact. RektD merges the universal appeal of crypto culture with groundbreaking technology, delivering a unique...</p>

<p>CUT THE BS!!!</p>

<p>There is nothing revolutionary, no one is dedicated and there will be no impact, except for the impact to your face when you, degens, get rekt by yet another coin. But hey, at least we are being honest. And if you want to read about &quot;groundbreaking technology&quot; then go read abour Cardano or smth, they are good at writing pages about this shit while doing absolutely nothing for years. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i6hvJjx.gif" /></p>

<h2>Rektonomics</h2>

<p><img class="intro" id="about" src="rektd.jpg" style="width:300px" /></p>

<p>We create the token, we create the LP, we control the token and the LP. We dump when we want and we rug if we want. Just like any other &quot;project out there.</p>

<p>This is all you really need to know, but since you may want to DYOR (as if it helped you even once) then here are the details:</p>

<p>- 10B tokens total supply<br />
- 3B pre-sale for $10k, what is not sold will be burnt (or maybe not, it is rekt after all)<br />
- 3B LP (yes, all the pre-sale will go into the LP, smart ass)<br />
- 1B for marketing (shilling this pump and dump including drops)<br />
- 1B for the team to dump on you</p>

<p>We will not rug or dump for the first 48 hours (promise). Pre-sale will be fair (means you will actually get your tokens). Then after that you will get rekt at some point. Before rekting you, we will take a snapshot and you will get an NFT for getting rekt. The more you get rekt, the more rare NFT you will get. #1 rekt spot will get the unique NFT.</p>

<p>We promise that the NFTs will be very beatiful and awesome, crafted by a top crew of real artists and designers, just like our website.</p>

<p>This is all you need to know about the tokenomics - you will get rekt and you will get an NFT for that. In between you can trade it, try to pick top and bottoms, DCA into a never ending downtrend or whatever else you do with any other useless coin out there.</p>

<h2>Faq(u)</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- What is the token address?<br />
-&nbsp;Find it on the website or Twitter once available. Don&#39;t buy a fake RektD, if you do that, you are not a degen, you are a retard.<br />
<br />
-&nbsp;Will you rug right away?<br />
-&nbsp;No, that would not be fun. We promise not to touch ANYTHING (lp or our tokens) for at least 48 hours after the launch. We will see after.<br />
<br />
-&nbsp;Will I get an NFT if I get rekt for just a few $?<br />
-&nbsp;No cheapo. We don&#39;t know what the cut off will be, but if you lose $0.01 you are not rekt and don&#39;t qualify for the NFT.<br />
<br />
-&nbsp;Why would I buy something that will go to 0?<br />
- We don&#39;t know. Why would you buy 167th iteration of UsedcarWifHatInAnalos and get rekt there, when you can get rekt here, make history and get an NFT for that?<br />
<br />
-&nbsp;Wen launch, wen moon, wen rekt?<br />
-&nbsp;Check our Twitter or TG group, all the information will be there.</p>
